This project is an interactive photo gallery showcasing stunning images of nature, including serene lakes, majestic mountains, and lush landscapes. Built with HTML, CSS, and jQuery, it allows users to filter images by categories (e.g., All, Nature, Architecture, People), view responsive layouts, and interact with a lightbox feature. Hover effects enhance the user experience, and clicking on any image opens it in an enlarged view with a dark overlay, which can be closed by clicking outside the image or using the close icon. Key images include a reflective lake at sunset, a dense green forest, and towering mountains under a dramatic sky.
